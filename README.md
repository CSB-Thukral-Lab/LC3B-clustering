# LC3B-clustering
This repository contains the materials and scripts used to generate the figures in the BioRxiv preprint titled "LC3 Forms Functional Nanoclusters on Autophagosomes" by Fatihi et al. (2024). If you are using these scripts or data in your work, please cite the original paper:
Fatihi et al., BioRxiv 2024.

The simulation data includes .xtc and .gro files from the three replica coarse-grained (CG) simulations, as well as all the minimized dimer interface structures explored during the study. Note that these files have been processed to exclude water molecules in order to reduce file sizes.
